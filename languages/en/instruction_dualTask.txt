You will see the stimulus stream in this task. 

In this block we will ask you to identify the NUMBER string and the RED WORD when they appear in the stimuli stream.

You should decide if the RED WORD was semantically related or unrelated to the context word presented at the beginning of the trial.
If the RED word was semantically RELATED, please press the F key on your keyboard.

Also you should indicate whether the NUMBER string was even or odd.
If you see an ODD NUMBER (i.e. 1111111), please press the F key on your keyboard.
If you see an EVEN NUMBER (i.e. 4444444), please press the J key on your keyboard.

Please focus your attention and try to answer as accurately and quickly as possible. When you are ready, we will begin the test.
