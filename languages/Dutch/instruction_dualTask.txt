You will see a context word (e.g. CAT).
Then, you will see a really fast series of letter strings (e.g. FGHBVDT), one after the other.
One of them contains a repeated digit (e.g. 7777777).
Another one contains a target word (e.g. XXDOGXX) in red. 
First, decide if the target number is odd (3,5,7,9) or even (2,4,6,8).
Second, decide if the target word is related or unrelated to the context word.
(e.g. CAT-DOG, and BRIGHT-DARK are related, but CAT-SKY are not related)
